# Steam_Monitor
Utilize the Steam API

- compare multiple friends games
- compare multiple friends achievements for a game, currently steam only allows one friend for one game
- utilized [this gem](https://github.com/Olgagr/steam-web-api)

## Ideas
 - show user stats, basic info
 - all the graphs of all the things
 - choose a random game based on unplayed games or some comparison of stats
 - maybe some kind of relation between time played, cost, etc vs actual prices, etc
 - if accessible, money spent over time, related to sales
 - if accessible, amount actually spent and how many games on sale, %-wise
