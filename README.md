# Steam_Monitor
Utilize the Steam API
# Ideas
 - show user stats, basic info
 - all the fun numbers and API features
 - thinking of having a random game feature based on unplayed games or some measurement
 - maybe some kind of relation between time played, cost, weekends, nights
 - if accessible, money spent over time, related to sales
 - if accessible, amount actually spent and how many games on sale, %-wise
 - maybe some relation between time played and types of games, compare percentages
 - big data
